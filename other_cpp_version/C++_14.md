# C++ 14
## New language features
1. [variable templates](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/variable_template.html)
2. [generic lambdas](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda.html)
3. lambda init-capture
4. new/delete elision
5. [relaxed restrictions on constexpr functions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constexpr.html)
6. [binary literals](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/integer_literal.html)
7. [digit separators](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/integer_literal.html#Single_quote)
8. [return type deduction for functions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/function.html#Return_type_deduction_.28since_C.2B.2B14.29)
9. [aggregate classes with default non-static members initializers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization.html)


## New library features
1. [std::make_unique](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr/make_unique.html)
2. [std::shared_timed_mutex and std::shared_lock](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/shared_lock.html)
3. [std::integer_sequence](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/integer_sequence.html)
4. [std::exchange](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/exchange.html)
5. [std::quoted](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/manip/quoted.html)
6. and many small improvements to existing library facilities, such as
   - two-range overloads for some algorithms
   - type alias versions of type traits
   - user-defined literals for basic_string, duration and complex
   - etc.
